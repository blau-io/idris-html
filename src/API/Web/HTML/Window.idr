||| A FrameRequestCallback is the function to call when it's time to update an
||| animation for the next repaint. The callback has one single argument, a
||| DOMHighResTimeStamp, which indicates the current time for when
||| requestAnimationFrame starts to fire callbacks.
FrameRequestCallback : Type
FrameRequestCallback = DOMHighResTimeStamp -> JS_IO JSRef

||| RequestAnimationFrame tells the browser that you wish to perform an
||| animation and requests that the browser call a specified function to update
||| an animation before the next repaint. The method takes as an argument a
||| callback to be invoked before the repaint.
-- I would love to have this as a Nat instead of an Int. It is specified that
-- this method returns an unsigned long, but Javascript has a weird concept
-- of numbers, so we somehow ended up using Ints.
